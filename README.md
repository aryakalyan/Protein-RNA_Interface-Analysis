# Protein-RNA Interface Analysis

This repository provides a Python-based workflow to identify interface residues and nucleotides in binary protein-RNA complexes based on accessible surface area (ASA) data from NACCESS. The analysis includes:

✔ Counting interface atoms in protein, RNA, and complex.  
✔ Identifying interface residues & nucleotides in protein & RNA.  
✔ Calculating the total interface area for protein, RNA, and complex.  
✔ Visualizing interface residues as spheres using PyMOL.

## 🚀 Features

🔹 Reads NACCESS ASA output files for protein, RNA, and complex.  
🔹 Identifies interface atoms and residues based on ASA differences.  
🔹 Calculates total interface area in Å².  
🔹 Generates CSV output files for further analysis.  
🔹 Creates a PyMOL script to visualize interface residues.
